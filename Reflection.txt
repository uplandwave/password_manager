Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
    The first one that comes to mind would be out of that chemistry assignment when we took
of text from the user that represented a chemical code and broke it into endevidual elements.
That was realy cool to me and showed the power of functions and their abilityto keep your code
neat and readabe. 


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
    Test functions have some value. To me I like that I can test for a very specific outcome
and the program can let me know if all of the background tasks are working and running in the
same way as I expected.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
    I would be basic in my answer, with this class and with my other coding classes I read
the error message they give and more often then not I will find I have miss spelled somthing
or am missing the proper formatting needed. If I canot find my error I like to ask other people
if pocible befor cunsoltin the internet because I can get a better explenation.
