### General use 
When you run Circle K you will be asked what you want to do,
```
1) Generate new password
2) Look at Vault
3) Put in a new password
4) Exit
What would you like to do?
```
Just enter the number of the step you want Circle K to preform ex. 1 Enter to have Circle K Generate you a password.

When calling a password from your valut put in the name of the sight with a capital first letter meaning, **"Youtube"** not **"youtube"**. This is another securety feature just incase you leave Circle K open.

#### Error
If you ever get an error at the start of the program or stop the program in the middle you will need to run the "Test_Encription.py" file to re-encrypted your password file (private.txt). 

If you ever have any problems with the encryption or get locked out of your text file I have also encluded a plain text version of the password text file for you to recover from and also see the formating. 

---

#### Keys 
The key to the encryption is in plain text in the code for easy use by you. It can be easly hidden by directing Circle K to get the key from the "filekey.key" file if you would like. There is also a key genorator located in "Test_Encription.py" witch is commented out if you would like to creat a new key or key file.

#### Testing
If you would like to run the test file run "Test_of_tests.py". You can add to this new tests as you expand the program to meet your needs
